Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Sam Hedges, a hardworking and ambitious soul with an immense love for game development. Currently, in my 2nd year at Anglia Ruskin University, pursuing a BSc in Computer Games Programming. ðŸŽ®

But there's more to my story! ðŸ“–
From shadowing the game dev disciplines at Ninja Theory to Quality Assurance at Frontier Developments, I've dabbled in a bit of everything in the industry. 
If you're wondering about my non-gaming quests, they include leading the troops at Wilko, ensuring your fries are crispy at McDonald's, and even doing some freelance graphics coding.

When the screens are off, I balance the binary with some good old-fashioned books, mindfulness through meditation or you'll likely find me at the gym working on that physical XP.
Dive into my repositories to witness the magic of C#, Unity, and my adventures in graphical shaders. Also, always on the lookout for collaborations and interesting projects!

Happy coding, and let's connect! ðŸš€
